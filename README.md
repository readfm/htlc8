# htlc8
HTLC == hash time lock contract   
try simple ui before adding money   

make options easy to make/select in contenteditable TEXT   
test the flow, see what we need before doing real HTLC  

# simple

keep input in permanent one place (directly under url)

| < find open contract (future clickables) on "|" options input

0000000008 |yes|no| show seconds remaining before EXPRIY in timechain

# thlc8a

strictly timechain plans future above present input while logging past below, one time dimension

http://timechain.one simple timechain: on enter the timed input line writes under next line to input

time hash lock contract on timechain can put actionable offers ABOVE input area and log

# htlc8b mvp  

player   // public key shortcut, can be next not yet   
time     // now     
expiry   // 8 seconds from now  default for testing     
oo       // options "yes|no" default    
action   // write to timechain how player bets    
name     // "htlc8" default     
describe // "push git" default   
later    // check if repo pushed before expiry    
result   // write to timechain what happens on expiry

stuff below later maybe if above ok thanks   


HTLC = hash time-lock contract    
8 hours from now, thing happens or not    
A yes it does   
B no it don't  

does not need money or btc yet    
focus now on simplest logic and text ui   
maybe    

NAME THING ON FIRST LINE   
8 hrs from now say what it does, like define a time in future when   
A thing happens or    
B not   

^ so in 4 lines we get    
NAME to find thing    
WHAT it does by WHEN (8 hr default constant for now)   
A print this or do thing 'a' if thing happens by when    
B print or do thing 'b' if not    

or anything similar, text only is best  
so player need less ui and make options easy   
and play w 8 hour loop    

https://t.me/rust_in_bitcoin miniscript maybe but we prolly don't need money yet   


# htlc8c maybe        
1 input offer // get player input prolly on paste   
2 find offer // on input '.oo' list oo things   
3 format offer // time, options, name, description on one line for now      
4 select option // make options clickable    
a if player selects write to timechain // switch bet easy, apply latest bet       
5 write timechain result on expiry // tell player this game is over
